# The Impact of Lionel Messi’s Arrival on Inter Miami  
### A Data-Driven Case Study on Performance and Fan Demand in MLS

## Project Overview
This project analyzes how Lionel Messi’s arrival affected Inter Miami’s on-field performance, competitive results, and fan demand in Major League Soccer (MLS).  
Using match-level data from the 2023–2025 seasons, the analysis evaluates both short-term and sustained impacts of a global superstar signing, with a focus on translating sporting outcomes into business-relevant insights.

## Research Questions
- How did Inter Miami’s on-field performance change after Messi’s arrival?
- Did improved performance translate into better competitive results (points)?
- How did fan demand and estimated matchday revenue evolve over time?

## Data Sources
- Match-level statistics and attendance data from **FBref (MLS)**
- Seasons covered: **2023–2025**

## Methodology
The analysis follows a structured, case-study approach:
1. Clean and prepare match-level data for analysis
2. Label periods before and after Messi’s arrival to capture short-term and sustained effects
3. Compare performance, results, and attendance across periods
4. Estimate potential revenue impact using attendance-based proxies

## Key Findings

### On-Field Performance & Results
- Goals per match increased steadily following Messi’s arrival.
- Improvements in attacking output translated into higher points per match, indicating that performance gains led to tangible competitive success.

As a robustness check, a supplementary analysis of matches where Messi served as captain shows even stronger on-field performance, reinforcing the main conclusions.

### Fan Demand
- Average attendance surged immediately after Messi’s arrival.
- While attendance moderated in subsequent seasons, it remained structurally higher than the pre-Messi baseline, suggesting sustained fan interest beyond initial hype.

### Estimated Revenue Impact (Attendance-Based Proxy)
Using average attendance increases as a proxy for matchday demand, the analysis estimates that Messi’s arrival generated substantial incremental ticket revenue potential for Inter Miami.  
Under conservative assumptions (average ticket price of $40 and 17 regular-season home matches), the post-Messi periods correspond to approximately **$4–9 million in additional matchday revenue per season** relative to the pre-Messi baseline.

The largest revenue uplift occurred during the immediate adaptation phase, followed by sustained—but gradually moderating—incremental revenue in subsequent seasons, consistent with a transition from short-term hype to stabilized demand.

## Business Implications
The findings suggest that Lionel Messi’s signing created value through multiple reinforcing channels:
1. **Improved on-field performance**, reflected in higher goals scored and points per match
2. **Sustained increases in fan demand**, as measured by attendance
3. **Meaningful incremental matchday revenue potential**, estimated using attendance-based proxies

Taken together, the results indicate that the signing functioned not only as a sporting upgrade but also as a high-impact business investment with both immediate and durable returns.

## Limitations
- Revenue impacts are estimated using attendance-based proxies rather than direct financial data.
- Ticket price assumptions are simplified and may vary by opponent, seating category, and match importance.
- The analysis focuses on a single case study and may not generalize to all star signings or teams.

## Conclusion
This case study demonstrates how a global superstar signing can influence team performance, competitive outcomes, and fan demand in Major League Soccer.  
While centered on Inter Miami and Lionel Messi, the findings help explain why MLS clubs increasingly pursue marquee international players as part of broader league growth strategies.

## Next Steps
Future extensions could compare similar high-profile signings across other MLS teams or incorporate media, sponsorship, and broadcast metrics to further quantify league-wide commercial impact.
